### Discussion Points and Takeaways

- There are many studies, organizations, and things that work. But this requires time, attention, and/or money that is all in short supply.
- There is a lot of unpaid work that goes into increasing diversity. Often ends up on the shoulders of the underrepresented groups.
- People don't want to be seen or known as the person that focuses on diversity. The career effect can be negative. 
- There is a tendency to focus on gender. We should include all aspects of diversity.
- Training data in Machine Learning can encode a history of bias. Good book on this: Weapons of Math Destruction
- "Walled gardens" can sometimes be unproductive. Often the focus is on bad experiences, and the negative energy can be detrimental to progress. 
- This is not a "pipeline problem". 
- How to increase exposure to new groups/ideas? Diversify your twitter network; follow new blogs

# Diversity Discussion Stickies

As part of a plenary session on diversity and inclusion, we asked attendees to write responses to the three questions below. Answers are listed with +1 for every "upvote" the stickie received.

## What's been done at events that worked?

- Code of conduct cluster
	- Opening event with statement about climate expectations (+3)
	- Be really up front and clear about expectations from participants i.e. code of conduct (+1)
	- Publicly enact code of conduct
	- Have a code of conduct
- holding "new comer" and "women in..." etc. type lunches on different days of conference which is attended by senior members as well (+2)
- child care grants / availability (+5)
- Buy-in from organizing committee, full time paid outreach coordinator. This led to really good results re. gender
- ensure a diverse program/organizing committee. this leads to a more diverse group of speakers. (+7)
- specifically recruit/invite diverse speakers (+1)
- keep registration and participation fees low (+1)
- cluster on support
	- Provide women/URM travel grants
	- subsidize travel fee
	- In a discussion, people in different expertise will come up with a very different perspective, which helps forming new ideas.
- Diversity BOFs (+1)
- assign plenary talks to early career folks from diverse backgrounds
- putting effort/priority into it: working on the culture, not the quotas
- data as evidence
- top down culture change led by leader
- Cluster on calling out program committee
	- as a speaker: request or demand organizers run a progress to expand inclusion before acceptng speaker spot. (+2)
	- call out organizers when they fail to create a diverse conference/workshop with a transpanrent process (+1)
	- insist on more even panels at meetings (mae sure there are diverse members of discussion group leaders)
	- Balance panels
- smaller group discussion with (a) imposed groups and (b) a clear task
- faculty-trainee mixture session involving multiple groups
- training sessions led by vokunteers with the epertise of interest
- when reviewing applications for short courses, avoid admitting only from top R1 institutions.
- first question comes from a trainee (not a PI) (+3)
- Don't only feature work from underrepresented groups in a "special session" or panel (+7)
- discussion microagressions, especially about technical topics ("well, actually", etc.) (+1)

## What are things that your group/university do that work?

- Quick to gently correct implicit biases/gendered words (e.g., "women first"). (+5)
- Making clear when recruiting that we support students in a variety of career paths (+1)
- Require diversity statement by faculty, grad applicants (+1)
- one faculty member is appointed as an "inclusion officer" - becomes point person on hiring matters
- implicit bias training for students, faculty, staff (esp. those on hiring committees and admission committees) (+3)
- encourage broad participation in discussions 
- focus on lab members as mentees (vs. employees) (+5)
- collecting data around diversity/inclusion
- hiring minorities in pairs
- following up/checking in on URM students (+1)
- Maintain a diverse group (positive feedback loop)
- everyone is supportive and conscientious of everyone else's different views and perspectives in our lab group 
- International collaborations
- Interdisciplinary bachelor, master, and PhD program (+1)
- Paying attention to my privilege (+1)
- Hiring people from different fields (+1)
- hardware and software expertise required in our lab; diversity in our lab makes collaboration easier between these peopel and helps improve working efficiency.
- Actively consider diversity when hiring (+1)
- Listening and trying to understand different experiences (+1)
- Creating a positive and collaborative web environment (+1)
- Use the Rooney Rule when hiring
- admission of grad students: make sure there are X% women
- Graduate student fellowships available for increasing diversity
- have a lab code of conduct (+5)
- software code of conduct
- inviting seminar/colloquium speakers from diverse groups - inspires URM students (+5)
- Undergrad REU at Institute for Advanced Study - Women in mathematics - very successful
- undergrad advising: great way to get diverse students into research (later go to grad school) (+2)
- our uni has a high school intership program targeting dallas public schools (mostly underprivilaged and/or minority students). A few of us are developing an intro programming course for the group
- think about it when writing job descriptions (+1)
- Support efforts to improve community norms
- Structured interviews for hiring (+2)
- WISMAC (women in science and medicine) is a great group at our univerisity. They provide an informal mentorship program and have set up women friendly things like nursing rooms around campus (+1)

- handle harassement issues better
- take more risks on early- stage students who might increase diversity (+7)

- some sort of informal diversity training or more explicit guideliens about acceptable behavoir
- blinded short list construction for hires (+1)
- More formalized testing/decision process for candidate group members
- More metrics and data
- get majority of members investied
educate men about implicit bias (+1)

- recruit (actively) candidates that increase diversity
- more actively discuss issues of diversity as part of lab work/group meetings (e.g., once per semester at least)
- selecting/inviting diverse speakers at conferences

- reach out upstream for more diversity in the student body
- ignore GREs and deprecate grades for admission to grad/professional school (+7)
- host events in accessible spaces and cities
