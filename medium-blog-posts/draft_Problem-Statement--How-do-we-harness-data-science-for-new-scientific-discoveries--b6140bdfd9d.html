Had we made this post 5 years ago, we would have started by discussing the “data deluge”, or even “big data” across these fields. Today, this is the only time you see those terms, in this post anyway, and to many of us they sound out-dated.</p><p name="de1f" id="de1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But in fact — <a href="http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/infographic/four-vs-big-data" data-href="http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/infographic/four-vs-big-data" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fast-moving, high volume and high complexity data</a>, continue to disrupt our standard research practices, and continue to overwhelm a large fraction of our research colleagues. One thing has become clear over the last few years, this phenomena is not going away quickly. Yet we see certain labs, certain disciplines, and certain universities leveraging modern scale research data for generating new knowledge of how people, the world, and the universe work.</p><figure name="4491" id="4491" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 403px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 76.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*31u90R0Wf9RdcwDXzlt46A.png" data-width="869" data-height="667" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1080/1*31u90R0Wf9RdcwDXzlt46A.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Derived from <a href="https://medium.com/u/de04a04c4ff3" data-href="https://medium.com/u/de04a04c4ff3" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="de04a04c4ff3" data-action-value="de04a04c4ff3" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--figure-user" target="_blank">Drew Conway</a></figcaption></figure><p name="791a" id="791a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">When we see this kind of data-intensive research success it is generally because those research domains have moved into much closer conversation with computer scientists and statisticians. Further, these collaborations or intersections seem to work best when they are mutually beneficial: with domain research problems motivating advances in computational and statistical methods and theory.</p><p name="df55" id="df55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><br>Data science for research is emerging as a convergence of these three areas, from its foundations in computer science and statistics, and its continued innovation and advancement through applications in domains of research and beyond.</p><p name="78ad" id="78ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We feel it is essential that when we speak about data science at this early stage of its development, that we include the research domains as an equal partner in its definition. Whether you believe data science is an emerging field of intellectual pursuit, a paradigm shift happening across all of the sciences, or a temporary term that will eventually disappear as technology gets more turn-key, there is utility in keeping its definition in this intersection.</p><ol class="postList"><li name="a7a8" id="a7a8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">For one thing, it is clear that data science is having a large and growing impact on all areas of human endeavor. </li><li name="c782" id="c782" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We also see that the people who are building up data science in academic research are coming from all three of these broad areas, from the social, life, and physical sciences, as much as from computer science and statistics. </li><li name="cdda" id="cdda" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">In addition, it may be that it is the interdisciplinary nature of data science that makes it such a powerful tool for discovery.</li></ol><p name="a260" id="a260" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">We feel the time is ripe for a dual focus on both the technical advancement of data science for research as well as the academic context of this emerging type of research including, specifically, the challenges and opportunities for the research university. There are many good discussion on the application of data science for research, and in fact many of the research the Moore and Sloan foundations fund take advantage of these new techniques.

Can university structures and disciplinary definitions of excellence change to accommodate this new kind of research? And how does a modern university compete for talent given the intense demand from industry?</p><p name="1e4d" id="1e4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These questions are at the heart of the <a href="http://msdse.org" data-href="http://msdse.org" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments</a>. The partners in this endeavor have articulated a few themes, that we think are useful to structure our discussion. They are not the only way to think about data science for research, however, they do provide a straightforward and generally understandable set of topics that almost everyone here is grappling with in some form. </p><ol class="postList"><li name="41ff" id="41ff" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Career paths for these new types of scientists; </li><li name="5ed7" id="5ed7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Software Tools and Methods developed and employed by data scientists; </li><li name="4d92" id="4d92" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Physical and Intellectual Space for collaborations; </li><li name="ce3e" id="ce3e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Open and Reproducible Research</li><li name="b211" id="b211" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Education and Training for the next generation of data scientists; </li><li name="f760" id="f760" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">and a self reflective theme around the study and understanding of this emerging practice of data science.</li></ol><p name="5acc" id="5acc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">We wanted to take a moment to call out a theme that is relatively overlooked, and yet seems to be the secret sauce in almost everywhere we have seen with some success around interdisciplinary areas of research: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the physical and intellectual space needed for data science collaborative work</strong>. </p><p name="5baa" id="5baa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The scientific community has not tired of getting together in person, however, in our day to day lives on campus, dedicated physical spaces, so essential to collaborative work at the intersection of established disciplines, are often hard to come by. By creating a place for people to gather, work together, and bump into each other, we create an environment conducive to greater understanding when we are developing the shared language of data science.</p><p name="74e0" id="74e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some of the work of our colleagues at NYU, UW and Berkeley are looking at this phenomena of collaborative space for data science specifically in a systematic way as part of what they call “Data Science Studies”, and building connections with others around the world who have been looking at team science and interdisciplinary science for years. </p><p name="2d29" id="2d29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What have you found works with regards to building spaces for data science &amp; interdisciplinary work? Are the themes articulated above the necessary and sufficient set of considerations in building data science for research? Is data science an emerging discipline or an emerging paradigm of science across all disciplines, or both/neither?</p><p name="7202" id="7202" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We look forward to exploring these questions with the scientific community!</p><p name="813f" id="813f" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
