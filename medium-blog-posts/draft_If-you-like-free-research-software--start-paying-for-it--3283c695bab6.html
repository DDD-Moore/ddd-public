Software for our research is no different, and with the invention of open source software, it seems we have a great solution. Not only is open source software free (as in beer) but its also free (as in speech). What could be better for research than Free Open Source Software (FOSS)? </p><p name="2426" id="2426" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One can verify FOSS, opening the blackbox of the code to know how it actually works. One can modify FOSS, making it work better for our and others’ needs. Its perfect for science. Except that it is nearly impossible to sustain for the long term without massive industry support. </p><p name="235a" id="235a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Foundations and Federal funding agencies don’t generally support FOSS projects for the long term. Generally our funding cycles and mandates dictate a 3–5 year horizon for projects that really should like 10–20 years. Much has been said about this cadence mismatch, but that is not my point today.</p><h3 name="3325" id="3325" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Marketplace for Research Software</h3><p name="6434" id="6434" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">At a recent conference on sustainable software for research, the idea of a market place, and appropriate metrics of software quality, came up, again. This idea of a bottom line for services and products that otherwise don’t cost money comes up frequently. In fact in the early days of the Moore Foundation we tried coming up with “outcomes” as the currency of impact for our work. Again, trying to find an analog for cash for those efforts whose results we care about, but which don’t have a way to make money.</p><p name="2b0b" id="2b0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Research software delivers value to its users, at least the codes that are actually used provide value. But we, the science community who use this software, do not feel like we should exchange value with the makers. Why? Well it obvious: it didn’t cost the makers anything to make it, they got a grant to do the work, right? Moreover, the grant came from public funds, likely, and so in a sense, I, as a researcher, have already paid for it through my taxes.</p><p name="ddf4" id="ddf4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Making people pay for software also increases friction towards adoption, making getting started even harder. It also goes against the ideal of the free exchange of ideas, given much of scientific software is mainly an implementation of an idea, not a hardened, scalable, or sustainable tool.</p><p name="0364" id="0364" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we dream of a catalog of research software, using complex and imperfect metrics to determine which software is worth using, worth funding, worth it at all. Alternative metrics of impact, beyond usage, beyond contribution of code. We would love to know how our users are using our software, but wont put telemetry into our downloaded software for fear of appearing to “spy” on our fellow scientists. Invasion of privacy is a no-no, though we often left commercial software capture usage data (they also ask), and always let online, hosted software capture our usage without any opt-in.</p><h3 name="0e96" id="0e96" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">So, you don’t want us to use FOSS for research?</h3><p name="8bd0" id="8bd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Well, not so fast. I am all for FOSS, in fact we help fund a lot of FOSS for many of the reasons mentioned above. I am not abandoning it, but I would like to think about other models or paradigms that take advantage of both FOSS and the commercial software space. A hybrid system.</p><p name="1929" id="1929" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have hybrid systems now, most notably: Freemium. But we also used to use another hybrid system, and that is what I would like to focus on for a moment: shareware.</p><p name="6115" id="6115" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ok, so I just dated myself for mentioning shareware. I had to link it to wikipedia so many of you reading this would know what I was talking about. But bare with me, as shareware offers something different than Freemium, that I think matches the needs of researchers and research software creators, with some small tweaks.</p><h3 name="357a" id="357a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Cash or Data, pay what you can</h3><p name="cd47" id="cd47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Shareware lets the user decide whether they want to pay for the software they are using. It is an honor system, and it likely doesn’t work very well or else we would still see it operating today. Instead we hobble our software, making users pay for “premium” features, and get a cut down version for free. But this wont work for research software, which requires full, unfettered access, including looking under the hood.</p><p name="4bc4" id="4bc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"> But what if we brought back shareware for research software, with a twist? Offer your FOSS software like you always do, and then indicate that if you use this software, you should pay for it: with cash, with your telemetry usage data, with a paper citation, or all three.</p><p name="1126" id="1126" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I suspect is that at first nothing would change. Think Winzip (((IS THIS RIGHT??))), it always asks you to pay, but never enforces it. But then, a few things will start to sink in to users: 1) they will start equating the opt-in telemetry data with value, in other words, they will start to understand that the developer finds it valuable to understand who, how, and what people are using their software for. 2) They will do better at citing the software they use in their papers (still the dominant form of impact for researchers), and 3) They will start to pay for the software they get the most value from. </p><p name="cc32" id="cc32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">These then all become the indicators of impact we all seek for research software. It becomes a possible sustainability plan for very popular software, and it potentially paves a path forward to how funders can support software development. I know the NIH and others are experimenting with “chits”, where their grantees essentially vote for the software they like/use. An even better chit is cash. Give researchers money to pay for the software they use, and then what do you have: a marketplace. Actually, you just have commercial software, that is also FOSS.</p></div></div></section>
